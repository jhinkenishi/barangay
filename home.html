          <p>
            Bani is a barangay in the municipality of Rosario, in the province of La Union. 
            Its population as determined by the 2015 Census was 1,654. 
            This represented 2.98% of the total population of Rosario. 
            <img class="zoom-element" src="images/BaniPangasinan.jpg">
            Bani was founded on March 18, 1769 (from Zambales). In May 1903, it was transferred to Pangasinan together with the towns of Agno, Alaminos, Anda, Bolinao, Burgos, Dasol, Infanta and Mabini. San Simon, the original Bani, was transferred from Namagbagan to sitio Almacin in 1859.
            The Immaculate Conception, Patron Saint of San Simon, disappeared from the church altar and discovered on top of the tall Bani tree in the vicinity of the present Church. She was brought to the Namagbagan church, and returned to the present site. Bani's name came from the Bani tree where the image of the Patroness was found. Bani (Millettia pinnata) is a smooth tree (height of 8 to 25 meters).
            In 1769, Fr. Mains de Lamberto erected a "visita" in Bani with settlements around Don Cayo banks and in 1762, these settlements became a sitio, with local officials headed by Don Francisco Baltazar as "Tiniente Absolute".
         
            On 21 November 1903 the town of Bani together with Alaminos, Bolinao, San Isidro de Potot and Infanta were annexed to Pangasinan. In 1918 the road from Alaminos to Bani was started. During the time of Martial Law the mayor of Bani was Marcelo Navarro, a member of the Liberal Party. After the People Power of 1986 the OIC who headed Bani was Edmundo Cacho
            Bani is the hometown of TV host and former Pangasinan governor Oscar Orbos. From the Municipal Hall one would read that this town used to be a part of Zambales and its founders include Pangasinenses, Ilocanos and Zambals.
            In May 2009, Bani along with Anda and Bolinao, was severely damaged by Typhoon Emong. The typhoon damaged an office close to the Municipal Building, the Western Pangasinan Lyceum, and a lot of structures and houses.
